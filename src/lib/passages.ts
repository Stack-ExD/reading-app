    title: "The Secret Life of Honeybees",
    content: `Inside every beehive, there is a world more organized than most human cities. A single
hive can contain up to 60,000 bees, and every single one has a job to do. At the center of
the hive is the queen bee. She is the only bee that lays eggs—up to 2,000 per day during
summer. Despite her title, the queen doesn't actually make decisions for the hive. Her
main job is simply to lay eggs and keep the colony growing.

The worker bees are all female, and they do everything else. Young workers stay inside the hive, cleaning cells,
feeding larvae, and building honeycomb from wax they produce from their own bodies. As
they get older, they graduate to guarding the hive entrance.

The oldest workers become foragers, flying up to five miles from the hive to collect nectar and pollen. Male bees
are called drones. They don't collect food, don't guard the hive, and don't have stingers.
Their only purpose is to mate with queens from other hives.

In autumn, when food becomes scarce, the workers push the drones out of the hive to conserve resources. Bees
communicate through dancing. When a forager finds a good source of flowers, she returns to
the hive and performs a 'waggle dance' that tells other bees exactly where to find the
food. The angle of her dance shows the direction relative to the sun, and the length of
her waggle shows the distance.

This tiny insect has been making honey the same way for over 100 million years. Every spoonful of honey represents the life's work of about twelve
bees.`,

    title: "The Mystery of the Deep Ocean",
    content: `The deep ocean is one of the most mysterious places on Earth. It begins about 200 meters below the surface, where sunlight starts to fade. In the midnight zone, which starts at 1,000 meters, there is no light at all. Temperatures are near freezing, and the
    pressure is intense.

    Despite these harsh conditions, life thrives in the deep. Many animals have evolved bioluminescence, the ability to produce their own light. They use this light to attract prey, find mates, or scare away predators. The anglerfish, for example, uses a glowing lure on its
    head to attract smaller fish.

   Giant squids also live in these depths. They can grow up to 40 feet long and have eyes the size of basketballs to help them see in the dim light. Sperm whales are known to dive deep into the ocean to hunt these giant squids.

   At the very bottom of the ocean, there are hydrothermal vents. These are like underwater volcanoes that spew hot, mineral-rich water. Bacteria live around these vents, using the minerals to produce energy through a process called chemosynthesis. This forms the base of a
    unique food chain that doesn't depend on the sun.

   We have explored less than five percent of the world's oceans. Every expedition to the deep brings new discoveries of strange and wonderful creatures.`,

    title: "Magellan’s Voyage: The First Circumnavigation of the Globe",
    content: `In the 16th century, an age of great marine and terrestrial exploration, Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to sail around the world. As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king’s favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.

A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.

One ship deserted while in this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellan’s men died of starvation and disease.

Later, Magellan became involved in an insular conflict in the Philippines and was killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and 17 sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no precipice at the edge.`,
